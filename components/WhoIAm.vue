   <Divider class="my-4" />
   <p>
    I call myself
    <b>SarcAceTic</b>
    on the internet, but my real name is
    <b>Zhell</b>
    , though I prefer to be called by the former. I'm an Indonesian teenaged
    hobbyist, and my main hobby is programming, specifically web development. I
    got into making Discord bots in the past, but I left all that behind and now
    I'm here.
    <br />
    <br />
    I also am interested in arts, bodybuilding, cyber security, and a little bit
    of video games. I really wish to do something else that is more than web
    development one day, if I ever succeed in this field.
    <br />
    <br />
    Right now I am focusing on improving my web development skills, especially
    Fullstack development so that I can land a job and fund for my future
    expenses with the aforementioned hobbies, so I can continue to do even more
    interesting, productive and goofy things! I am happy with how things have
    turned out recently with programming, and I wish to do even more.
