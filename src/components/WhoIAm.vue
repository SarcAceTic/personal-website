    Hi! My name is Sarc / Ryn! I'm an Indonesian teenaged (15 years old)
    hobbyist, and my main hobby is programming, specifically web development. I
    got into making Discord bots in the past, but I left all that behind and now
    I'm here.
    <br />
    <br />
    I also am interested in arts, and a little bit of video games. I really wish
    to do something else that is more than web development one day, if I ever
    succeed in this field.
    <br />
    <br />
    Right now I am focusing on my academics, and I wish for myself to get out of
    Indonesia to explore many opportunities. I am also learning German!
    <br />
    <br />
    Below are advices that I have written for future hobbyists and self
    learners, or even current ones. I hope the things I've listed below could
    help you in your journey, and I'll also be giving you my personal
    experience.
