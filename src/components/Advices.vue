    You may be the same as me. You're a hobbyist! You're a self learner, and you
    like learning and doing stuff, especially from the internet! But, of course,
    everything has hardships and obstacles. And that goes the same for self
    learning. You may feel burnt out, you may feel like giving up, you may feel
    like you're not good enough, you may even have hard time starting out, all
    because of monetary problems, motivation, disabilities, etc. If you've felt
    these, which almost everyone does... Then it may help reading these below.

    Don't be scared to start out
   </h3>
   <p>
    In this day and age, there are just too much information to digest and
    process. But, how are you going to start if you're just scared forever? I
    know it seems daunting, and I know it seems really hard at first, but if you
    keep being consistent, optimistic, and taking little steps, you're suddenly
    way above where you just started! Trust me, that's how I progressed too.

    <br />
    <br />
    Within my personal experience, when I just first started out web
    development... I had NO idea what I was doing. I literally coded like a
    caveman. It was all messy, jumbled up, and even more so on the UI design...
    but as I went on and on, I learned from my mistakes. I went from not being
    able to make a basic header with 6 hours of time to making a whole landing
    page in just an hour!

    You don't need a lot of money
   </h3>
   <p>
    There seems to be this misconception that you need a very high budget or
    capital to start learning stuff and doing things. Guess what?
    <b>You don't.</b>
    Yep. When you try to learn stuff, sure, you can spend a lot of money to
    fasten your progress, but it's absolutely
    <b>NOT</b>
    a requirement. Such a huge no. You can still be a very skilled hobbyist, and
    all you only need is two things:
    <br />
    <b>time and effort.</b>
    That's the cheat code, and it'll get you so far than money will ever do.
    Don't believe me? Let me give you my experiences!

    <i class="text-gray-400">My beginner digital drawing</i>
    <br />
    <br />
    I know that's really bad artwork, but I pulled this off without any huge
    amount of money (except for the drawing tablet) whatsoever! Not even
    expensive art courses! All I had were YouTube tutorials and image
    references.
    <br />
    <br />
    It doesn't even necessarily always translate to art. This applies to almost
    everything! When you game dev, you can use free assets. When you want to
    work out, you only need your bodyweight. When you write, you only need your
    keyboard. It's all just about time and effort!
   </p>
   <h3 class="font-pops uppercase text-2xl text-center my-10 font-semibold">
    You don't need talent
   </h3>
   <p>
    I HATE this! This is one of my biggest pet peeves! You
    <b>don't need</b>
    talent to be great in the things that you do! Albert Einstein needed to
    learn how to count before he could develop the theory of relativity. Usain
    Bolt needed to learn how to walk before he could be the fastest human on
    Planet Earth. And same goes to you! You need to actually go out there and
    learn to do things that you want to do! Talent is not important, and as
    always,
    <b>time and effort</b>
    beats everything. Believe in yourself and your capabilities! Everyone is
    different, of course.
    <br />
    <br />
    And everyone has their own natural capabilities. But just because you don't
    have that natural capability, doesn't mean you shouldn't chase your dreams!
    Hell, it doesn't even affect your journey that much on a significant level!
    There are talented people out there who are too lazy to actually do
    anything!

    I don't think I am talented. Yet, I still did the things that I do.
    Programming. At the time, I didn't even care if I was talented or not. Why?
    Because I enjoyed doing it. I enjoyed the process, and I truly enjoyed the
    results of my work. It doesn't matter if you're talented or not, as long as
    you are improving, and you truly enjoy the process of the creation.
